ReacTickles is an example of designing for playful interaction. Whilst ReacTickles has a broad educational role in fostering creativity and imagination, the focus in on simple, user-initiated experiences rather than the evolution of a particular skill-set. The design of ReacTickles is extraordinarily simple. Two-dimensional shapes and forms reward user input with a variety of chromatic and phenomenological responses. Without complex interface elements the user is an liberty to explore and create meaningful performances. Functionality is superseded by playfulness, which is achieved by prioritizing sensory experimentation rather than cognitively demanding tasks. Sensory technologies have a vast potential to bring control and meaning to software users regardless of their linguistic, social or cognitive abilities.  They enable many forms of communication, most importantly, body language, touch, gesture, rhythm, pattern and sound.  Developers are finding new ways to exploit the sensory and phenomenological dimensions of technologies and to imbue our everyday experiences with opportunities to play.

The core vision for new ReacTickles is to draw on the desire of the developer community to make technology irresistible and to find an application for playfulness by acknowledging the needs and desires of user groups who would normally be expected to use computers pure to assist functionality. All people benefit from the opportunity to play - for it's intrinsic value in creating feelings of positivity. By engaging people at a sensory level, whereby feelings of control are supported through the properties of the technologies, new possibilities for interaction can arise, for many people this might be the key to unlocking potential.

As the first step in moving the ReacTickles concept forward we will create new interfaces that can be transfered across platforms. Initially this is likely to be mainstream devices in order to maximize involvement and integrate the existing user experience.

Designing for iPhone is a major component of this. iPhone apps are aleady inspiring developers and users, what is of particular interest to us is not only  mobility, meaning that experiences can be personally situated, but more importantly, the tactile properties. Even though the surface is smooth, hard and shiny, it offers sensorial experiences such as tilting, smoothing, stroking, pressing, circling, squeezing, pulling, in other words, exploring. The bonus of the iPhone is that is is more than a communication tool, it can actually enhance social interaction.

By making the development process open and transparent, our intention is to unite developers and user communities. The previous website attracted a wide range of users, however the most loyal and regular visitors have been adults and children on the autism spectrum, together with their families and carers. However, without the input of enthusiastic developers, the site was difficult to maintain and the content remained static. For this reason our plan for reactickles.org is to host a dynamic gallery of ReacTickles and to bring people closer together through the desire to play and experiment.

The research team have a long-standing relationship with schools and community groups throughout the UK, as well as parts of Australia, New Zealand and China. These groups will continue to participate in our studies. The site will invite partners to collaborate in design, evaluate prototypes and take part in workshop-stype activities. Feedback will be encouraged in a variety of forms. There will also be publications and presentations related to ReacTickles, covering a wide range of disciplines.
